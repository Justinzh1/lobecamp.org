### Specific Aims

#### AIM 1
Are you drunk!? Our speakeasy The Double-Blind Pig serves placebo-controlled refreshments. While you sip, ask the local (inebriated?) scientists all your burning questions (results may vary)

#### AIM 2
Can we tickle your brain!? Play with our interactive neurotech, mind-stretching games, and discover the neuroscience of your favorite drugs!

#### AIM 3
Ready to blow your mind!? We’re not just nerds, we’re artists too! Study our scientifically inspired pieces co-created by neuroscientists and friends. 

### Summary
WE WANT YOUR BRAINS to test our innovative approach to nerdy fun on the playa!
